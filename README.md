# Who wants to be millionaire?

It's a simple implementation of the [Who wants to be a millionaire](http://wwbm.com/) game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

1.  **Node.js**: [download from nodejs.org][node-download] or check the
    [official installation guidelines][node-package-manager-download] if you
    prefer using a package manager

2.  **NPM**: usually is installed with Node but you can have a look at the
    [installation guide][npm-install]


## Getting started

When you pass all [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) you can `cd` into the
project directory and start development as follows:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the website.

__Well done! ðŸŽ‰__


## Production build

Simply do the following:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
